# Programming with JavaScript

## Control flow

<span style="color:green">Control flow</span> is the flow in which the computer executes our code.  
Typically when a program is run it will execute from top to bottom unless otherwise specified by conditionals and loops.  

## JavaScript Functions

a JavaScript <span style="color:green">function</span> is a block of code made to perform a certain task and is executed when it is "called".  When we are using a JavaScript function it will look like this" function myAge(p1, p2) {return p1 - p2;}".  The <span style="color:green">Parameters</span> are listed in parentheses in the function definition. While function <span style="color:green">Arguments</span> are the <span style="color:green">Values</span> received by the function when it is invoked.  The code inside the function will execute when something <span style="color:green">Invokes</span> the function.  Invoking can take place in these three different ways:
- automatically
- when an event occurs
- when it is invoked from JavaScript

When JavaScript reaches a  <span style="color:green">Return</span> is when that function will stop executing.  Functions often compute a <span style="color:green">return value</span> which is returned back to the "caller"

## JavaScript Operators

The "=" is the <span style="color:green">Assignment</span> operator to add a value to a variable. There are a few operators that work to do arithmetic these are:
- "+" for addition
- "-" for subtraction
- "*" for multiplication
- "**" for exponentiation
- "/" for division
- "%" for modulus (division remainder)
- "++" increment
- "--" decrement
