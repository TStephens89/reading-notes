## Debugging

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
- Syntax is a problem with how you worded something usually missing punctuation or misspelled words and logic errors are when you use the wrong logic
2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
- The most recent lab I had a lot of spelling errors and linter errors I had to commment out my whole code and I uncommented line by line until I found the issue.
3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
- I think using these skills and understanding the different error codes I will be able to more efficiently find my mistake.

## JS Debugger

- the Debugger is a took we can use to look into our code and execute in certain ways to better find the problem
2. Define what a breakpoint is.
- these are places where the debugger pauses in execution to identify issues.
3. What is the call stack?
- This is where we whas has been executed this far.
