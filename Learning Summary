From the reading we learned about Github.  Github is platform that will allow us as students to create 
and learn the basics of coding without learning the deeper aspects on exactly how.  When I think of how
we are able to add to github by using plain text I would say it is coding with training wheels.  
The language that we are using with Github is Markdown.  In Markdown, we can easily input whatever words we
would like and the software will do work in the background to have it display how we choose.

Markdown has a list of inputs that will allow people who use it what needs to be done to perform differnet actions.
For example, when starting out usually you will have a heading in this "cheat sheet" you will find that "#" is what 
is needed to add a heading the more "#" added will give you more subheadings.  I also learned that we are able to 
change if the text is bold or in Italics by wrapping the text in different symbols like "** **" for bold or
"* *"for italics.  These basic concepts are just the start of what you can get done using Git.  We are also able to 
easily add image attachments by just dragging and dropping from a destination from our computer to the Git file box.
