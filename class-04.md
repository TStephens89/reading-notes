# HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Function

## Things I want to know more about

LOOPS!!!!
- I also need more info on functions


## Links

- We will use the `<a>` element to link things
- by adding the `href` attribute we can show which page we want to link to
- We have different options on how to link pages depending on the situation
- 'the `id` attribute can be used to target elements  within a page that can be linked to'

## Layouts

- `<div>` can be used to group sections together
- browsers choose how to display content unless you specify otherwise
- `float` allows us to wrap items around other content
- using a grid will help create a professional design
- "CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks"
- If our page needs multiple CSS files linked we can do that

## Functions, Methods, and Objects

- `Functions` allow us to use a set of instructions over and over
- to declare a function we would use the keyword `function` followed by the functions name `countNumbers()` then after we have input steps in that function we can later call it by writing the function name 
- in the parenthesis of our function we are able to establish paramenters
