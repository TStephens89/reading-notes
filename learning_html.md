# Learning HTML



## Wireframming

### What is it?

**Wireframming** allows people who are desinging a webpage to draw out the basic design of the website.  There are many paid and free and paid sites that allows you create this outline digitally even though it can be done with pen and paper.  We want to draw out a general layout and positioning of the information for the page we will be making.  Creating this will start you and give you a visual on where you need to go when you are actully making the code for the page.

## HTML

### What is it?

**HTML** or Hyper Text Markup Language is whats on the page and how it is structured.  Within HTML we use *opening* and *closing tags* to tell the computer what we are trying to do (Ex. "< b> this text will be bold if I did not put a space in the opening tag</b>).  The example consisted of the full **Element** which includes opening tag>content>closing tag. We also have **attributes** which are specified in the opening tag that provide more info. While using HTML you have the option to add a lot of different functions that will allow your page to be unique.

## Semantics

### What is it?

**Semantics** are how we express what a certain piece of code means.  Semantics are important because it gives context for what you are doing.  This becomes very important as we move from different languages to make what we are writing make sense in the particular language.
