Hello World My name is Trevor Stephens and I am a former Navy sailor.  I served in the USN for 9 years and I am now exploring a passion of mine since I have finished highschool.  I am now learning to code through [Code Fellows](https://www.codefellows.com) and I am excited to continue learning to transition to another career.
