# Short Bio

I am Trevor Stephens, I recently ended my Navy career of 9 years to find a job that I had a passion for.  Growing up in Atlanta, GA and Nashville, TN I wold always find myself geared towards something tech related but I did not know where to start to follow my goal.  
This lead me to the Navy where I was still unfulfilled because my job had less to do with computers than I expected (Aviation Electronics Technician).

**The Growth Mindset**

In the very start of this class I opened Github read instructions and immediately felt overwhelmed because of life events so I immediately stopped and started thinking I was not in a position to complete the first task.  
I took sometime called my parents asked for advice and was pleased that my Dad explained the growth mindset to me to give me motivation to stick with what I want to do.
I was able to log back in and to my surprise our first assignemt was on what I had just been taught.
The growth mindset is a way of not allowing yourself to stop yourself from being great in my opinion.
People often have goals but when met with adversity they divert to this task is too difficult to complete.  
After reading the blog and talking to my dad I learned several things that will keep in the growth mindset and here are a few:

1. *Do not overwork and give yourself a chance to come back to the problem at hand*

2. ***not to lose focus on the task at hand and push through whatever obstacles are in your path.***

3. Staying focused on my end-goal and the things I need to do make it to my destination.

4. ~~I needed a forth to show my cool markdown skills~~ :smiley: so disregard this.
