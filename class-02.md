# Basics of HTML, CSS and JS

## Things I want to know more about


## Text

* We are able to add six levels of headings as the numbers go up the font is smaller ` <h1> ` will be the largest while ` <h6> ` is the smallest.
* ` <p> ` tags are used to create paragraphs
* ` <b> ` tags we can make characters **bold**
* `<i> ` tags will put text in *italics*
* we are able to combine a list of different changes to the content of our HTML code to better structure our page


## Introducing CSS

- CSS allows us to take anything we have included in the structure and then change and style it to make our pages unique
- When we use CSS we assign rules to specific HTML elements
- We use rules, selectors, properties and values to assign style to our html file.
- We are able to make these rules directly in our HTML file or we can make a seperate ` .css ` file and link it to our document

## Basic JavaScript Instructions

- With JavaScript we are able to make a series of instructions that the computer follows from top to bottom unless otherwised  specified.
- Scripts that are written must be formatted in a way that the computer is able to understand otherwise our code will not work
- <span style="color:blue">variables</span> are stored data
- <span style="color:blue">Arrays</span> stores a collection of data
- It is important to tell the computer what kind of data it is handling otherwise we may get unexpected results or errors.

## Decisions and loops

- we are able to have the computer make decisions based on conditions set previously.
- by using comparison operators like ==, !=, ===, !== and many more we can allow the computer to compare situations and make a decision based on that comparison
- we can use logical operators like &&, ||, and ! to have the computer see if certain statements are true or false.
- `if` statements all us to set condition based on if a certain condition is met
- `else` statements will set another option for the computer once the if condition is not met
