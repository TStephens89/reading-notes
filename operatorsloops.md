- Assignment

## Comparison Operators

A <span style="color:purple">Comparison Operator</span> compares its operands and returns a logical value based on if it is true or not.  When trying to compare the computer typically will try to convert the type so it can give a response unless we use "===" or "!=="

## Assignment Operators

An <span style="color:purple">Assignment Operator</span> will assign a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.  This looks like "x = 12" the operator is "=" the 12 is what is being assigned to x

## Loops and Iteration

### What do they do?

<span style="color:purple">Loops</span> will take what you have and repeat the statement. a few different loop statements are:
- for 
- do...while
- while
- labeled
- break
- continue
- for...in
- for..of

### For statements

The for statement will repeat a loop until the condition is no longer true.

### While statements

a while statement will execute as long a condition is true.  Once the condition is false the loop will end.
