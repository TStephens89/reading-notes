## Version Control

There are three different types of Version controls that I have learned about that will allow for different 
ways to store save points.  The three systems are as follows:

1. **Local Version Control** - which is a database on you local HD that stores different change files.
2. **Centralized Version Control** - This is just like the local version control except it is stored in a database
3. **Distributed Version Control** - Is like the dirst two but it is stored across each developers computer.

### Git  

This is the program that we will use to store all of our files.  Git is also a **distributed version control system**
that will allow its users to colloborate across multiple computers on a single file.  Within Git we are 
able to use a "snapshot" of the current file we are editing.  These snapshots we are called **commits**
which we usually identify as a savepoint for the particular version.  When referencing the **head** in Git that would
be the current place we are in the file save.  While using [GitHub](https://www.Github.com) we are able to save and store our **repositories** (central place where we store data) on the website but we are also then able to **clone** this data for use 
on our computer without [GitHub](www.Github.com).
