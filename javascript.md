# Dynamic Web Pages with JavaScript

## What is JavaScript

JavaScript is a lightweight programming language that is used in web environments as well as non web Environments.  JavaScript is often confused with another programming language called Java these two different languages are different and use different syntax and symantics.  When we look at all the things learned this far HTML is the structure, CSS is the visual, and I would say JavaScript is what you are doing.

## What goes into it

To start there is a lot that goes into JavaScript but some of the simple things we learned are <span style="color:blue">Variables.</span> (var) and <span style="color:blue">Constants</span> (Const).  Variables we are allows us to store into memory certain values whether that is a numeric value or letters and I am sure many other things as we get more in depth with JavaScript.  

## JavaScript Identifiers

<span style="color:blue">Identifiers</span>  will allow use to label out varibles.  What this means is when we use "var x =10" x would be the identifier.

## The Assignment Operator

It is important to know when using the "=" in JavaScript it is what assigns a place in storage but it does not mean equal.  If we were trying to use the equal it would look like ==.

## Data types

JavaScript can become very complex when looking at what kind of data it can handle the main thing we will focus on will be numbers and <span style="color:blue">strings</span> (text values) when we decide to use numbers we do not put them in quotes but for strings we would use quotes.

## how it is used

When in Javascript it is important to <span style="color:blue">Assign</span> value to the particular variable you want to use.  For example if we have "var  MyAge;" we have just declared that until we say otherwise "MyAge" is undefined so we need to then assign a value.  When we do this it will look like "MyAge = 33;" now we have declared "MyAge" in a place in memory as well as assigned a value to what we have declared.
