# Learning Summary

From the reading, we learned about Github. Github is a platform that will allow us as students to create and learn the basics of coding without learning the deeper aspects of exactly how. When I think of how we can add to GitHub by using plain text I would say it is coding with training wheels. The language that we are using with Github is Markdown. In Markdown, we can easily input whatever words we would like and the software will do work in the background to have it display how we choose.

Markdown has a list of inputs that will allow people who use it what needs to be done to perform different actions. For example, when starting usually you will have a heading in this "cheat sheet" you will find that "#" is what is needed to add a heading the more "#" added will give you more subheadings. While using Markdown here are just a few items I learned that we can use to spice up our code.

1. *When we wrap our code in a single asterik our code will be in Italics*
2. **By wrapping our code in two asteriks we make bold text**
