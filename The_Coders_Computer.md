### The command line

When I think about the command line I think of it as the back door behind our functions that we would use
other applications to use.  In the command line we are able to navigate and change things throughtout our computer.  
A few things we can do in the command line is:

* Navigate through our files and folders
* ls gives us a List 
* Paths take us from one place in our directory to another
* Absolute paths are referring to the root directory and always begin with ( / )
* Relative paths are referring to whatever directory you are in. These don't begin with ( / )
* cd stands for change directory and allows you to follow certain paths
* everything that we use is a file
* When saving documents it is important to know which system you are running because they recognize extensions differently
* When inputting items it is important to avoid spelling errors as well as case sensativity
