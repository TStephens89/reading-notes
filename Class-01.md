# Class 01

## Things I want to know more about

- I am still not very comfortable writing in HTML
- When I need to use different coding languages and incorporate them in HTML
- I wish I had a better understanding of key elements, attributes, etc to follow along better.
- Can the "ID" attribute be any label?
- Does the ` <div> ` element just group together in the same way that a block element would with an added attribute? 

## Chapter 1: Structure

- When we use HTML it is the structure of the webpage we are creating.
- <span style="color:blue">elements</span> - characters that live inside of brackets in HTML
- <span style="color:blue">tags</span> - is the container for the HTML element that usually will say something about what it is enclosing
- <span style="color:blue">attributes</span> - gives us even more information on the contents of an element


## Chapter 8: Extra Markup

- <span style="color:blue">DOCTYPES</span> are very important while writing a page because it tells the browser which version of HTML we are using.
- Comments in HTML are done between ` <!-- --> ` we want to get in the habit of writing comments so when we go back to our page we can easily see our thought process when writing or if you are collaborating with others.
- ID attributes will uniquely identify and element
- Class attributes will identify several elements
- block elements will start a new line within your web page examples of block elements are `<h1>, <p>, <ul>, <li> `
- ` <div> and <span> ` are both used to group elements together.
- ` <iframes> ` are used to display images of other webpages within your page
- ` <meta> ` tags are used to map out information about your code 
- certain characters are reserved in HTML and they are <span style="color:blue">Escape Characters</span> and we will need to use a special combination of characters to display the character.

## Chapter 17: HTML5 Layout

- the ` <div> ` element seems to be phasing out as HTML5 allows for other elements to describe the page layout
- HTML5 gives a more clear description of which element will do instead of adding attributes with a ` <div> ` tag
- Since HTML5 is so new more details might be needed to tell the browser how to display certain content.

## Chapter 18: Process and Design

- When making a webpage it is imporant to take note of who the page is for and desgn it to fit that audiences needs.
- During this process we will do a lot of how we want the page to be displayed as well as where we want it displayed this is called <span style="color:blue">Wireframing</span>
- The sitemap will act as a blueprint of where people can view certain information on your webpage


## JS Chapter 1: The ABC's of Programming

- <span style="color:Blue">JavaScript</span> will allow use to add instructions to our webpage
- The process of writing the script should be done in steps similar to this:
1. Define the goal
2. Design the Script
3. Code each step
- It is important to understand that humans and computers do not thing the same so you will need to most times over explain to receive the desired outcome.
- Objects represent physical things
- Properties describe the object
- methods are what makes the event happen
- events are what is triggered from user interaction
- JavaScript can be combined with HTML and CSS to creat beautiful interactive content on your webpage.
- JS can be used in the actual HTML document using a `<script> ` tag or it can be linked from a .JS file.
-
