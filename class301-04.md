# React and Forms

## Froms

1. What is a controlled Component?
a react component that renders a form that controls what happens to user input

2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
it depends but typically it is fine because sometimes it will benefit fuzzy searches.

3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
We can now pass it through other UI elements

1. Why would we use a ternary operator?

2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

`(x === y) ? console.log(true) : consolle.log(false)
