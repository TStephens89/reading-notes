# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

## Things I want to know more about

## Lists

- We will be working with three types of list 
  - Unordered - bullet
  - Ordered - numbered
  - definition - indention used to define terminology
- You can nest these list as well and it will look like what is written above.

## Boxes

- While using CSS we should know that it views each HTML element as a box
- When we are using CSS we are able to adjust how these boxes look and add style depending on how we want the site to look
- We can also choose to hide some of these boxes if it suites our page.
- When styling these boxes we can adjust the look of these boxes and the placement of them

## Basic JavaScript Instructions

- arrays can be looked at like a bucket that we place data in and is stored.
- with this stored data we are able to add as much or as little as we want (in JavaScript)
- to create an array we can use the `[]` 
- the values in an array are indexed in chronological order
-we are able to add and remove items from arrays as well as edit items in the array

## Decisions and Loops

- Switch statements are similar if statements but give the code a cleaner look in some cases.
- we can use a switch statement that will check for a true statement on each case and if there is on it will run the code for that case
-using break will have the code stop from reading if the case is found to be true
-In JavaScript we have truthy and Falsy statements
-Truthy statements are one of the following: 
  - true
  - any number other than 0
  - strings with content
  - equations
- Falsy statements are:
  - false
  - 0
  - empty strings
  - NaN (Not a Number)
  - variables without values assigned
- We can use `for` `while` and `do..while` to make loops
- it is important to have a way to end the loop
