# Design Web Pages with CSS

## What is CSS?

**CSS** (Cascading Style Sheet) is a rule-based language that allows users to describe how HTML is displayed.  CSS lets us design our web pages to have an original look.  **Documents** are text files in a markup language like HTML, SVG, or XML to name a few. **Presenting** is the process of converting that document into a usable web browser.  To start in CSS you want to use a **selector** to tell the computer what you are changing. For example:

h1{color: blue;}

would change the color of my heading to <span style="color:blue">blue.</span>
It is also important to know the compatability of different web browsers when using CSS because not all browsers are created equal.

## How do we use it?

When it comes to using CSS we have 3 options 
- External CSS
- Internal CSS
- Inline CSS

When using an *External style* we are able to add by linking the previously designed style in the *head* portion of our HTML file.

When using *Internal style* we would most likely be trying to make changes to a specific page but it is still performed in the *head* section.

When using *Inline Style* this is done within the *style* attribute of the relevant element.
